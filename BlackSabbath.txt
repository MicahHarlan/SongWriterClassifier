"Black Sabbath"

What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh no

Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please God help me

Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please God help me

"The Wizard"

Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

"Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Wasp"

Visions cupped within a flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial

Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that grow read to your sorrow
Words that grow read no tomorrow

Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

Now from darkness there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cool and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in you have awoken

"N.I.B."

Oh yeah!

Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me till the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

Oh yeah!

Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me till the end of time

Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

Oh yeah!

Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

I see the look of evil in your eyes
You've been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deed
You will bear someone else's bitter seed

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
Well you know that it was he not me
And you know the way it's got to be

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Wickedness lies in your moistened lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Black cat sleeps on top of your stained bed
You sure wish that you could see me dead

Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

"Wicked World"

The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People got to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

A politician's job, they say, is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
While people here on earth are dying of old diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father

"Sleeping Village/A Bit Of Finger"

Red sun rising in the sky
Sleeping village, cockerels cry
Soft breeze blowing in the trees
peace of mind, feel at ease

"Warning"

Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream 
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who have I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

"Luke's Wall / War Pigs"

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh Lord yeah

"Paranoid"

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

"Planet Caravan"

We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The Moon in silver dreams
Falls down in beams
Light of the night
The Earth a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks
Dawn from night
And so we pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe

"Iron Man"

I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fill his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!


"Electric Funeral"

Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide

Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation minds decay

Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon

Dying world of radiation
Victims of man's frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down
To earth's cracking ground
Rivers turned to mud
Eyes melt into blood

Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Tearing falling rain
Ease the burning pain

Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral

And so in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing

Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to hell
Ever trapped in burning cell

"Hand Of Doom"

What you gonna do
Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know there's no return

Change your empty rules
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now it's killing you

First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning, you push the needle in
From life you escape, reality's black drape
Colors in your mind, satisfy your time

Oh you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now

Your Mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see life's reality
Push the needle in
Face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

Head starts spinning 'round
You Fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death hand starts to weave

It's too late to turn
You don't want to learn
Price of life is high
Now you're gonna die

"Fairies Wear Boots / Jack The Stripper"

Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
Fairy with Boots are dancing with a dwarf, alright now!

Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lie
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!

So I went to the doctor to see what he could give me
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do"

Yeah

"Sweet Leaf"

Alright now!
Won't you listen?

When I first met you didn't realize
I can't forget you for your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh yeah!

I love you oh you know it

My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me showed me around
My life is free now my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf though you can't hear
Oh yeah baby!

Come on now try it out

Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
Oh yeah baby

"After Forever"

Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
that God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.

"Children Of The Grave"

Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today are
Children of the Grave, Yeah!

You're searching for your mind don't know where to start
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.

Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love.
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed, yeah.

Lord of this world
Evil possessor
Lord of this world
He's your confessor now!

You think you're innocent you've nothing to fear
You don't know me, you say, but isn't it clear?
You turn to me in all your worldly greed and pride
But will you turn to me when it's your turn to die, yeah?

"Solitude"

My name—it means nothing.
My fortune is less.
My future is shrouded
In dark wilderness.

Sunshine is far away.
Clouds linger on.
Everything I possessed—
Now they are gone.
They are gone.
They are gone.

Oh, where can I go to
And what can I do?
Nothing can please me.
Only thoughts are of you.

You just laughed
When I begged you to stay.
I've not stopped crying
Since you went away.
You went away.
You went away.

The world is a lonely place.
You're on your own.
Guess I will go home,
Sit down and moan.

Crying and thinking
Is all that I do.
Memories I have
Remind me of you.
Of you.
Of you.

"Into The Void"

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits

Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day

"Wheels Of Confusion / The Straightener"

Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion

Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears

So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah when you're gone!

"Tomorrow's Dream"

Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache
Before it takes me away from my mind

Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have to depart

"Changes"

I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever had

She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way

But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long
To realize
That I can still hear
Her last goodbyes

Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

"Supernaut"

I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun
But I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me

Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind

"Snowblind"

What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles are in my brain

Something blowing in my hair
Winter's ice, it soon was dead
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me

Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling go

Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one that's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong

Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?

"Cornucopia"

Too much in the truth they say
Keep it 'till another day
Let them have their little game
Illusion helps to keep them sane

Let them have their little toys
Fast sports cars and motor noise
Exciting in their plastic place
Frozen food in a concrete maze

You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain

I don't know what's happening
My head's all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide

Take a life, it's going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use

You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain

"St. Vitus' Dance"

So you think you know
What's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money
But it's you she wants instead

When you think about the things
That she did long ago
It breaks your heart but deep down
Boy, you don't want her to go

You really look so shattering
You feel you want to die
Just because of the one mistake
Of telling you a lie

If I were you I'd try again
And try and make amends
She only thinks of you, you know
I'm talking as a friend

"Under The Sun / Every Day Comes & Goes"

Well I don't want no Jesus freak to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door, now my mind's been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life, I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration

People hiding their real face
And each one's running their rat race
And behind each flower there grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way you'll find in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"

You seen right through distorted lies
You know you have to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn

The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And there's just no return

You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
You bastard

Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell

Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dognose
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath bloody sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you

"A National Acrobat"

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

When little worlds collide
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories
Are cast into the never ending well

The name that scorns the face
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that
Belies the fate of those who never ran

You gotta believe me
I'm talking to you

Well, I know it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on

I want you to listen
I'm tryna get through

Love has given life to you
And now it's your concern
Unseen eyes of inner life
Will make your soul return

Still I look but not to touch
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown

Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth
And live for every breath

Looking back I've lived and learned
But now I'm wondering
Here I wait and only guess
What this next life will bring

"Sabbra Cadabra"

Feel so good I feel so fine
Love that little lady always on my mind
Gives me lovin' every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never goin' away

Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright
Someone who needs me
Love me every single night

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world

Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me 'til the end of time
Makes me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine

Lovely lady make love all night long
Lovely lady never do me wrong
I don't wanna leave ya
I never wanna leave ya,
anymore no more
Lovely lady, mystifying eyes
Lovely lady, she don't tell me no lies
I know I'll never leave ya
I'm never gonna leave ya anymore no more

"Killing Yourself To Live"

Well people look and people stare
Well I don't think that I even care
You work your life away and what do they give?
You're only killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

Just take a look around you what do you see
Pain, suffering, and misery
It's not the way that the world was meant
It's a pity you don't understand
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

I'm telling you
Believe in me
Nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes
And see the lies, oh yeah

You think I'm crazy and baby
I know that it's true
Before that you know it I think
That you'll go crazy too

I don't know if I'm up or down
Whether black is white or blue is brown
The colors of my life are all different somehow
Little boy blue's a big girl now

So you think it's me who's strange
But you've never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
You'll end up paying till your dying day

"Who Are You?"

Yes I know the secret
That's within your mind
You think all the people
Who worship you are blind
You're just like Big Brother
Giving us your trust
And when you have played enough
You'll just cast our souls
Into the dust
Into the dust

You thought that it would be easy
from the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?

"Looking For Today"

It's complete but obsolete
All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play

Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried

Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen

At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today

Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today
Looking for today

"Spiral Architect"

Sorcerers of madness
Selling me their time
Child of god sitting in the sun
Giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry

Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should

Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disquise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should

Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay
Give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love
Is showing me the way
Spiral city architect
I build, you pay

Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good

"Hole In The Sky"

I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine

I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonym of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky
Gateway to heaven
Window in time
Through it I'll fly

I've seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cars

Hole in the sky
Gateway to heaven
Window in time
Through it I'll fly

I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now we're living on the profits of crime

"Symptom Of The Universe"

Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes

Yeah

Mother Moon—she's calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Yeah

Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years
With our love we'll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Yeah

Woman, child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love

"Megalomania"

I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control

Where can I run to now?
The joke is on me
No sympathizing God, it's insanity

Why don't you just get out of my life?
Why don't you just get out of my life now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone?

Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudo-god dreams
The ghost of violence was something I'd seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene

How could this poison be the dream of my soul
How did my fantasies take complete control?

Why don't you just get out of my life?
Why don't you just get out of my life now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone?

Well I feel something's taking me I don't know where
It's like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now

Sting me!

Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I'm going backwards but I'm in control

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity from the depths of sorrow

Was it wise to disguise?
How I tried to get away from you now
Is there a way that I could pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?

How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now

Suck me!

I'm really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth
I'll chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine
I set the trap but it was me who fell

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I've found my happiness from the depths of sorrow

No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worship you
Now I'm free, let me see
That now instead I won't be led by you now

Free!

"The Thrill Of It All"

Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die

Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in Man?
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold

Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don't even exist
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

So come along, you know you matter to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought
Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

"Am I Going Insane (Radio)"

Everybody's looking at me, feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I feel free, think I'll find a place to hide
Tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be
Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

So I'm telling all you people, listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizophrene
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

"The Writ"

The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you

What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you

The hateful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you

The shock troopers laying down on the floor
I wish they’d fallen into my private war with you
Yeah with you

Are you devil, are you man
You’ve changed a lot since you began
Yeah began

Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through

You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the dark that you never heard came true
Yeah came true

Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone
A poison father with his poisonous son, that’s you
Yeah that's you

I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you

All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true

Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed a lot since it began
It began

Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through

Cats, rats

The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing
Leave the living for another day

Rats, rats

You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a figment of a thing unknown
A mental picture of a stolen soul
The fornication of your golden throne

A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery

My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was smart
I feel my world is torn apart

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind

I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I feel I'll blow my mind

"Blow On A Jug"

Blow on a Jug
Everybody come on - blow on a jug
Be like me and blow on a jug
I want you to blow on a jug
Everybody begin - blow on a jug

Back Street Kids"

I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in others' eyes, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise

Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you getting so high
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

"You Won't Change Me"

I'm just a man and I am what I am, yeah
Nobody will ever change my ways
I don't need money and I don't need no lies, yeah
I only need to live for today
But I'd like to talk things over with you
I want to hear the things you say, today
Although you won't change me anyway, oh no way

I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you
I want to set my mind all free
You understand me woman, you give me time, yeah
But I don't need no sympathy
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved
Instead of hiding in myself
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

So listen to me now, hear what I say, yeah
Please give me time and maybe love
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me
I need him now to set me free
'Cause it may be that it's over for me
If you don't hear the things that I say, today
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

"It's Alright"

Told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright

Where to go and where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be
It's alright, yes it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That's it's alright, yes it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, yes it's alright

"Gypsy"

Watching the universe at the end of another day
Fatalistic ships form a distant shore
In the back of my mind I could see she was standing there
Like the feeling you have
When you've been there before

She was a gypsy woman
She was as cold as the day, yeah
She said I'd got it coming
And then she took me away, yeah

She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream
I thought it's over me, she wasn't all she seemed

She took my hand and then she started to speak
She told me she'd had the call
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul
She looked into her crystal ball
She read my fortune then she read my mind
She didn't like my thoughts at all

She showed me shadows, a spectre of life
My soul just wanted to scream
She stared so deeply into my eyes
That's when I fell into a dream
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me
And she read me with her eyes, she said

So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now, now, now

Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag
You are the queen of all hell
You took my body, now you're wasting my soul
You've got me under your spell
And as the sun shines on another day
You're gonna take my mind as well, it's over

So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy

"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)"

Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeah

Since he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeah

I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alright

People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine

Pretty silly ladies, all Cynthia's and Sadie's
Call him and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman, I should have seen it coming
And she's saying she's married to a clown
Just like a lady she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well I might, oh alright, yeah

Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups
Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away

He makes me happy when I'm feeling down
Take away my worry takes away my frown
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away

If you wanna feel groovy
Give the doctor a call, yeah
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away
Oh, right away...

"She's Gone"

I've been gone a long long time - waiting for you
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife

The days are passing slowly, since you've gone
Your memories are all I have, yes I have
I sit here waiting but you'll never show
Without you I can't carry on, ooh my baby

You said you'd always love me, all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye
Why the sudden change, why all the lies?
I should have seen it in your eyes

The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain
The silent emptiness of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby

"Dirty Women"

The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright

The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, You've got me going around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around

Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy

A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...Dirty Women"

The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright

The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale

Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen

A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...

"Never Say Die"

People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said "partners in crime!"

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

"Johnny Blade"

Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone
People avoid him, they know the street's his own
Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild
Mean as a tiger, society's own child

Those that tried to burn him paid
You don't do that to Johnny Blade
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?
He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate

Rivals all across the land
He kills them with his knife in hand
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

Well you know that Johnny's a spider
And his web is the city at night
He's a victim of modern frustration
That's the reason he's so ready to fight

He's the one that should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

Oh he knows his future's decided
And he ain't gonna change it, no way
He was born to die in the gutter
He'll keep fighting `till the end of his days

Been alone all through his life
His only friend is a switchblade knife
He's the one who should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

You fool the people
Who's fooling who?
It's time to listen
Who's fool are you?

"Junior's Eyes"

Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear
Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died
Yeah!

They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?
Yeah!

They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars
Yeah!

They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

"Hard Road"

Old men crying, young men dying
World still turns as Father Time looks on
On and on
Children playing, dreamers praying
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone
Has it gone?

Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road

Whirlwind churning, lovers learning
On this path of life we can't back down
Is it wrong?
Widows weeping, babies sleeping
Life becomes the singer and the song
Sing along

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to hurry
We'll meet in the end

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to worry
Let's sing it again

Brother's sharing, mother's caring
Nightime falling victim to the dawn
Shadows small
Days are crawling, time is calling
To the Earth another life is gone
Love line drawn

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load
Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road...

Forget all your sorrow, don't live in the past
And look to the future, `cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow, don't live in the past
And look to the future, `cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow, don't live in the past
And look to the future, `cause life goes too fast, you know...

"Shock Wave"

There's no reason for you to run
You can't escape the fate of the chosen one
Black moon rising, in a blood red sky
This time you realise that you're gonna die

Drinking your blood brew is your answer
That's what you plan to do
No dreaming, time you cheat this master
You're on your own going through

Wind of mist has taken over your mind
And you think you're on your own
Don't believe you are the only one here
Look around, you're not alone

Feel the forces from another world
Ghostly shadows fill your mind
Evil power hanging over you
As you freeze, you're like a child
Look behind you!

Somebody's calling
Someone is near
Feel yourself falling
Falling with fear
You tell yourself you're dreaming
You realise you're screaming
You know that this shouldn't happen to you
You tell yourself that it's scary too
But there is nothing you can do, oh!

Ghostly shadows from the other world
Evil forces in your mind
Trapped between the worlds of life and death
Frozen in the realms of time
Look behind you!

You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line
Your body is crawling, but your senses are blind
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brains
Ice cold fingers, running through your veins

"Air Dance"

She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind

In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away

And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now she dances only in her dreams

In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away

"Over To You"

Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison
You called a school
Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

Traveling endlessly, I'm searching my mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday you'll suffer
Then what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises
Over to you

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Tears full of sadness
Sealed in my cell
Whispering secrets
What do they tell?
Mad politicians
Can't tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you...

"Swinging The Chain"

It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
`Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You took up all the vandals
Will Hitler beat `em all?

And we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?

Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A comprimise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight

Yes we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days

I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking `bout sisters as well
I wish you good luck
Good luck!

Oh, but the world's still on fire
Chain the hope you take on, liar
This fire
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah...
